# Token or Asset issuance using Stellar

## Install

Nodejs is a prerequisite.

Install dependencies:

```
npm i

You also have to create a `config.json` file as specified in the `config.sample.json`, with accounts alreasy funded. You may use the [Stellar Laboratory page](https://www.stellar.org/laboratory/#account-creator?network=test) to create and fund those accounts.

## Usage

Simply follow the scripts in order.

`balance.js` displays the balances of each account.
